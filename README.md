## Description

This [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app is designed to help you analyze and extract valuable insights from challenging data formats commonly found in enterprise settings, such as HTML, PDF, CSV, PNG, PPTX, and more. 


This app uses [unstructured.io](https://unstructured.io) as a base library, providing an easy way to extract and convert unstructured data into a format compatible with popular vector databases and LLM frameworks. With this tool, you can streamline complex data handling and ensure compatibility with your preferred data analysis pipelines.

## Accessing the App 
You can access the app on the Streamlit Cloud community at [https://unstructured-demo.streamlit.app/](https://unstructured-demo.streamlit.app/).

## Getting Started
The app does not require any API key to function; extractions will be processed on streamlit cloud serverunless you choose to process them on unstructured.io server. 

However, if you choose to use unstructured.io API, I gave you a temporary key in the app, but it might be limited. Create your own at [unstructured](https://unstructured.io). After obtaining your API key, select unstructured.io API, enter your own API, and upload your file.
